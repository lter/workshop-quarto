## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- <u>Use</u> GitHub to make a new repository
- <u>Create</u> a Quarto website
- <u>Edit</u> files hosted on GitHub via RStudio

## Make a New GitHub Repository

From your GitHub **"Repositories"** tab, click the **"New"** button. It may be either **<span style="color:blue">blue</span>** or **<span style="color:green">green</span>** depending on your GitHub settings.

**Add a title** to your repository and **add a description**. Also, **set the repository to "Public"**; only public repositories can be turned into websites.

</p>

Once that is done, scroll down and decide whether to add (1) a README, (2) a `.gitignore`, and (3) a license. For Quarto websites, **you will want a README and a `.gitignore`** but a license is not _required_. If you are an RStudio user, **you should pick the "R" template for your `.gitignore`**. For more information on READMEs see [here](https://lter.github.io/workshop-github/readmes.html); for more information on the `.gitignore` see [here](https://lter.github.io/workshop-github/git_ignore.html).

</p>

Once you've added these two things, scroll down and click the **"Create repository" button**. Again, this may be either **<span style="color:blue">blue</span>** or **<span style="color:green">green</span>**.

After a few seconds you should be placed on your new repository's landing page.

## Clone that Repository

Now that you have created a repository, we need to clone it locally so we can create the content we want in RStudio. First, open RStudio and click the **project button** in the top right corner. If you use RStudio projects already, this will be the name of your current project. If you do not use projects it will say "Project: (None)".

<p align="center">
<img src="images/rstudio-clone-1.png" alt="Screen capture of the top right corner of RStudio when there is no active project" width="60%" />
</p>

When you click that button you should see a small menu appear. You should **click "New Project..."** (the topmost option). Note that if you use projects you'll see a list of up to the 10 most recent projects filling out the rest of this menu.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/rstudio-clone-2.png" alt="Screen capture of the top right corner of RStudio after the project button is clicked" width="60%" />
</p>

This will create a pop-up window in front of RStudio where you can decide what kind of project you want to create. Because we're cloning from an existing GitHub repository, **click "Version Control"**.

<p align="center">

</p>

In the next window, **choose "Git"**.

</p>

Before we address the next dialog window, go back to the landing page for the GitHub repository you'd like to clone. **Click the "Code" button and _copy the link_**. The "Code" button will likely be either **<span style="color:blue">blue</span>** or **<span style="color:green">green</span>**. In the example image below we're using a repository that has just been created but the process is the same for repositories that already have work in them.

<p align="center">

</p>

Now, return to RStudio and **paste the link that you just copied** into the top field of the new project pop-up menu. You must also **pick a name for your project locally** as well as **deciding where on your computer you'd like the local copies to live**. Feel free to name the project whatever you'd like so that you will be easily able to find it later.

</p>

Once you're happy with your entries to those fields, **Click "Create Project"**. You'll know this has worked when the top right of RStudio has whatever name you entered in the second field of the preceding menu. Also, you should now have a "Git" tab in your RStudio.

## Create the Website Skeleton

Now we've cloned the GitHub repository where we want the repository to live, we can create the critical website architecture. These steps are best handled sequentially but are semi-independent of one another so see the following numbered sub-headings for more instructions.

### 1. Add to the `.gitignore`

Using the "Files" pane of RStudio, open the `.gitignore` file. Scroll to the bottom and add the following to the bottom. Those two folders are important in creating a Quarto website but we don't want Git to track changes to the files that they contain.

```
# Ignore unneeded Quarto folders
/.quarto/
docs/
```
