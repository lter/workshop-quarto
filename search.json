Quarto includes a variety of user-friendly tools including a visual editor that allows users to insert headings and embed figures via buttons that are intuitively labeled rather than through somewhat arcane HTML text or symbols. Creating websites using Quarto is very similar to any other work in RStudio so many of your existing technical skills will likely serve you well here.",

Install Quarto\nBefore you can make a website with Quarto you will need to install it! This program seamlessly ties into RStudio so you won’t need to learn how to navigate a new program.",

These commands are mostly Command Line Interface (CLI) not R code! To make this as clear as possible, if the plain text instructions have this symbol  they should be run in the “Terminal” pane of RStudio while R code–if any–will have this symbol .\nThe “Terminal” pane of RStudio should be next to the “Console” pane of RStudio (see below). If you don’t have that pane, you can make a new one using the keyboard shortcut Alt + Shift + R (Windows) or Option + Shift + R (Mac). Alternately you can open a file in the top-level of your RStudio project then click through the following menu items at the top of the screen: “Code”  “Terminal”  “Open New Terminal at File Location”.",

It may be either blue or green depending on your GitHub settings.\n\nAdd a title to your repository and add a description. Also, set the repository to “Public”; only public repositories can be turned into websites.\n\n\n\nOnce that is done, scroll down and decide whether to add (1) a README, (2) a .gitignore, and (3) a license. For Quarto websites, you will want a README and a .gitignore but a license is not required. If you are an RStudio user, you should pick the “R” template for your .gitignore. For more information on READMEs see here; for more information on the .gitignore see here.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve added these two things, scroll down and click the “Create repository” button. Again, this may be either blue or green.\nAfter a few seconds you should be placed on your new repository’s landing page.",

First, open RStudio and click the project button in the top right corner. If you use RStudio projects already, this will be the name of your current project. If you do not use projects it will say “Project: (None)”.\n\n\n\nWhen you click that button you should see a small menu appear. You should click “New Project…” (the topmost option). Note that if you use projects you’ll see a list of up to the 10 most recent projects filling out the rest of this menu.\n\n\n\nThis will create a pop-up window in front of RStudio where you can decide what kind of project you want to create. Because we’re cloning from an existing GitHub repository, click “Version Control”.\n\n\n\nIn the next window, choose “Git”.\n\n\n\nBefore we address the next dialog window, go back to the landing page for the GitHub repository you’d like to clone. Click the “Code” button and copy the link. The “Code” button will likely be either blue or green. In the example image below we’re using a repository that has just been created but the process is the same for repositories that already have work in them.\n\n\n\nNow, return to RStudio and paste the link that you just copied into the top field of the new project pop-up menu. You must also pick a name for your project locally as well as deciding where on your computer you’d like the local copies to live. Feel free to name the project whatever you’d like so that you will be easily able to find it later.\n\n\n\nOnce you’re happy with your entries to those fields, Click “Create Project”. You’ll know this has worked when the top right of RStudio has whatever name you entered in the second field of the preceding menu. Also, you should now have a “Git” tab in your RStudio.",
