# LTER Scientific Computing Workshop - Creating Websites with Quarto

## Repository Explanation

This workshop covers how to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)--a tool developed by Posit--to create easily-customizable websites and host those sites on GitHub. Quarto includes a variety of user-friendly tools including a visual editor that allows users to insert headings and embed figures via buttons that are intuitively labeled rather than through somewhat arcane HTML text or symbols. Creating websites using Quarto is very similar to any other work in RStudio so many of your existing technical skills will likely serve you well here.
